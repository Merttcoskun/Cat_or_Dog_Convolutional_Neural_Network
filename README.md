<h3> Business Problems <h3>

The aim is to develop a model for automatically classifying dog and cat images. This model will be able to accurately predict whether a given image contains a dog or a cat."

<h3> Dataset Story <h3>

The dataset consists of dog and cat images.
- Training Set = 4000 dog images - 4000 cat images
- Test Set = 1000 dog images - 1000 cat images
- Single Prediction Set - 1 dog image - 1 cat image
